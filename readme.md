Scripts for Textual IRC.  These are mainly in AppleScript with other languages pinched in here and there.

Drop these scripts in your `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual5` folder and let the fireworks begin! If this folder isn't present on your machine, create it and add these scripts.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/phracker/textual-scripts "~/Library/Application Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual5/textual-scripts"
$ mv "~/Library/Application Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual5/textual-scripts/*" "~/Library/Application Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual5/" && rm -rf "~/Library/Application Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual5/textual-scripts"
```

`/py <python expression>` evaluates a python expression.

`/scc` will autojoin their IRC chans without using the web dialog, you just need to fill in your cookie info.

`/wr <location>` reports the weather for the provided location.

Some of these scripts were pulled from these guys, but needed some updating to work properly.
